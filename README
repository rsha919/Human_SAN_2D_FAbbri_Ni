These simulations were run on "Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS" using C and MATLAB codes.
"bmp_to_nv2_geo_maker.m" can be used to create geometry files to be used in the C code, using the .bmp images

1. run the code using "gcc Fabbri_Ni.c -lm; OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 ./a.out" in a terminal (optimal OMP_NUM_THREADS count varies by system hardware)
2. the output is in the form of a MATLAB variable stored in the folder "matlab_variable_output"
3. load the variable into MATLAB
4. enter the following in the MATLAB command window "eval(E_combining_string);"
5. enter the following in the MATLAB command window "E = squeeze(E(3:end-1,3:end-1,3:end-1,:));"
6. the results can be animated using:

for i = 1:size(E,3)
    imagesc(E(:,:,i))
    caxis([-80,20])
    colorbar
    pause(0.1)
end
